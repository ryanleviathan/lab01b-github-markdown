# Instructions #
## This is how you do the thing for the assignment ##
### _or at least how I did it_ ###

1) First, create a new repo with a README.me file
1) Then, 'git clone' that repo, using the https URL
1) Then you should cd /alchemy/foundations-prep/lab01-github-markdown
1) Then you should create the file tree:
    * mkdir to create src directory:
     `mkdir src`
    * touch to make greeting.md file:
    `touch greeting.md`
    * cd to src and mkdir to create __assets sub-directory:
    `cd src`
    then
    `mkdir __assets`
    * touch to make __index.html:
    `touch __index.html`
    * cd to __assets:
    `cd __assets`
    * touch to make __app.js and __style.css:
    `touch __app.js __style.css`
    * cd back to /alchemy/foundations-prep/lab01-github-markdown:
    `cd /alchemy/foundations-prep/lab01-github-markdown`
    * add your "Hello there!" greeting message using echo to greeting.md: 
    `echo "Hello there!" > greeting.md`

Once you've followed those steps, listen to this fantastic quote!
